# What are autotools?

- GNU Autotools is a suite of tools used to automate the
  *configuration*, *building*, and *installation* of software packages
  across different systems.

- Typical installation of a package using GNU Autotools
```
./configure
make
make install
```

---

# Example

main.c:
```
#include <netdb.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    struct hostent *host;
    host = gethostbyname("www.pdc.kth.se");
    ip = host->h_addr_list[0];
    printf("%d.%d.%d.%d\n", ip[0], ip[1], ip[2], ip[3]);
    return 0;
}
```

* `gethostbyname()` is provided by libnsl on Solaris

---

# Example 1

configure.ac:
```
AC_INIT([example1], [1.0])

AC_SEARCH_LIBS([gethostbyname], [nsl])

AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
AC_OUTPUT
```

Makefile.in:
```
example1:
	gcc -o example1 main.c @LIBS@
```

`./configure` will now produce a `Makefile` from `Makefile.in` replacing @LIBS@ with the proper value (-lnsl on those systems which provide gethostbyname through libnsl)

---

# What is autoconf?

- Part of the GNU build system

- Tool for producing shell scripts that automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of Posix-like systems

  - Running `autoconf` will take `configure.ac` as input
    and produce `configure`

- The autoconf tool is not required when *building* the package:

  - `./configure` will run tests, take `Makefile.in` as input
    and produce `Makefile`

# Inner workings of autoconf

- `configure.ac` as well as the tests are written in the macro language M4

- The `configure` script is a Bourne shell script

---

# Some useful existing tests

| Test                                    | Description                               |
| ----                                    | -----------                               |
| `AC_SEARCH_LIBS(FUNCTION, SEARCH_LIBS)` | Search for `FUNCTION` among `SEARCH_LIBS` |
| `AC_CHECK_LIB(LIBRARY, FUNCTION)`       | Search for `LIBRARY` providing `FUNCTION` |
| `AC_CHECK_FUNCS(FUNCTION...)`           | Define `HAVE_FUNCTION` if found           |
| `AC_CHECK_HEADER(HEADER-FILE)`          | Define `HAVE_HEADER-FILE` if found        |
|                                         |                                           |

# Example 2

<!-- TODO -->

test existence of alternative to gethostname

Use CC, CFLAGS etc in Makefile.in

---

# Mini-demo on computer (pause/relief)

---

#  What is automake?

- Writing `Makefile.in` for complex projects can get tedius and repetitive

- Automake simplifies and automates the making of Makefiles

- Takes `Makefile.am` and produces `Makefile.in`for `./configure`

- A `Makefile.am` is essentially a set of variable definitions.

---

# Example 3

Makefile.am:
```
bin_PROGRAMS = pdcip
pdcip_SOURCES = main.c
```

configure.ac:
```
AC_INIT([example1], [1.0])
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE()
...
```

Invocation:
```
# Done by developer:
$ autoconf          # configure.ac -> configure
$ automake          # Makefile.am  -> Makefile.in 
# Done by "user":
$./configure        # Makefile.in  -> Makefile
```

# We automatically get compilation targets

| Target         | Description                                                  |
| ------         | -----------                                                  |
| make all       | Build programs, libraries, documentation, etc. (= "make")    |
| make install   | Install what needs to be installed, copying the files from   |
|                | the package’s tree to system-wide directories.               |
| make clean     | Erase from the build tree the files built by ‘make all’.     |
| make distclean | Additionally erase anything ‘./configure’ created.           |
| make check     | Run the test suite, if any.                                  |
| make dist      | Recreate ‘PACKAGE-VERSION.tar.gz’ from all the source files. |

# Invoking configure

options, like --prefix

Separate source and build directories

När man utvecklar ett program:

./configure CFLAGS="-g"

./config.status

# Debugging autotools
